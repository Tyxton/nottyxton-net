            		<h3>>> THE_CHALLENGE</h3>
            		<p>Rewrite my old website to be something more visually appealing, and to have a greater focus on my projects in tech.</p>
			<br>
            		<h3>>> THE_SOLUTION</h3>
            		<p>I did a full site rewrite from scratch, this time implementing some JavaScript to gain some attention-grabbing visual effects.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I also focused on making the website more "professionally appealing" by keeping a consistent, legible, and interesting visual style.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I am currently rewriting the old pages to match the visual style and also detailing my processes in the homelab.</p>
			<br>
            		<h3>>> KEY_LEARNINGS</h3>
            		<p>All of the skills used on this project came from my experience in Website Development, though patience and trials were crucial to not only finding a new style that achieved the goals I desired, but rewriting dozens of pages is a task of itself.</p>

			<h3>>> JAVASCRIPT_CHALLENGE</h3>
			<p>When building the boot animation, I ran into an issue where everytime the page loaded, it would replay, <u>even on page redirect.</u> This was an issue I wanted to fix immediately since, while unique and visually appealing, looses its charm quickly when viewed dozens of times per visit. <u>Especially</u> when most visitors frequently jump between pages.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Any recruiters visiting my page specifically would be deterred by this, their time is valuable, so I had to figure something out.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>>> THE_SOLUTION</h3>
			<p>I implemented a session state check in the script, unlike localStorage, sessionStorage clears itself when the tab is closed meaning that the boot sequence will still play for the first time a user visits the website, but won't annoy them as they click through the various pages. This too, would allow for returning users to still get the animation, as it is a charm of the site.</p>
			<br>
			<p>To compliment the session state check, I also added a skipping feature so that when a user clicks, it will automatically skip the boot animation, and just show the content -- that way users don't feel forced to watch it. User satisfaction is a crucial part in UI/UX development afterall.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>>> KEY_LEARNINGS</h3>
			<p>In writing this script, I learned a key skill in web development -- Session State Management to compliment my skills in UI/UX design.</p>
